# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-MLproject

Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on patient data such as symptoms and medical history.

Project Structure
data/: Dataset for training/testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
src/: Source code for model and utilities.
models/: Saved machine learning models.
Dataset
Anonymized medical records with features like age, symptoms, and medical history.

Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Jupyter Notebook
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model: python src/train.py
Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.

Future Work
Incorporate more complex models (e.g., neural networks).
Expand dataset with more features and records
